### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Rajdeep.

## 
I am a Computer Science graduate, currently pursuing a Master's degree at York University. Before this, I was a Senior Data Scientist at [Inspektlabs](https://inspektlabs.com/). 
 
My main work revolves around the usage of deep learning (particularly ConvNets) to solve computer vision problems.

I have experience in: 
- Object detection
- Object tracking
- Image segmentation
- Image matting
- Generative Modelling

Proficient in Tensorflow and Pytorch, I am currently exploring ONNX.
